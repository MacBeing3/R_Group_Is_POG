## CATAN

we wanted to add color as a random variable that *should* have no effect, as we are generating it randomly

```{r Data Manipulation}
# Reading in Catan data from data folder
CatanData <- read.csv(file = 'data/catanstats.csv', header = TRUE)

# Creating object that has all of the desired colors
colors <- c("red", "blue", "white", "orange")

#applies all 4 colors per game with no repeats
CatanData$color <- unlist(
  lapply(
    split(CatanData, CatanData$gameNum),
    function(group)
    sample(colors))
  )



```




Here we are gonna train a rainforest model thingy based on our 50 games 


```{r do_game,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
#,message=FALSE



source("./simulatingCatan.R")

#to give the stats n plot for a Catan game, just enter a dataset of 4-player x 50 games (like the original)


predictCatan(CatanData,rf_model)

#predictCatanPlayer(player, rfmodel)

```

Here are the "importance" values for the rf_model. To simplify, this refers to how important a variable is in predicting the likelihood of winning

```{r importance}

print(importance(rf_model))


```


```{r graphs,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}





```
