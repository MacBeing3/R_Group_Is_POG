3) Statistical analysis

4) Plots
    win/lose stuff


5) Introduce at least one function from CRAN that hasnâ€™t
been used in class
    simulate Catan game?
    
6) Rmarkdown file (this is your final report)
    this file

```{r Data Manipulation}
# Reading in Catan data from data folder
CatanData <- read.csv(file = 'data/catanstats.csv', header = TRUE)

# Creating object that has all of the desired colors
colors <- c("red", "blue", "white", "orange")

# Creating new variable for color
# Split separates the observations by game Num, 50 groups for 50 games
# lapply does the random sample of colors for each group within each group
# This way, each color is found in each game without repeats within games
# Unlist separates data back into individual observations
CatanData$color <- unlist(
  lapply(
    split(CatanData, CatanData$gameNum),
    function(group)
    sample(colors))
  )
