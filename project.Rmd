## CATAN

1) At least one function you created
      predictCatan()
      
2) Data manipulation
      add colors to data
      creating new variables from input data for predicting Ctan
      
3) Statistical analysis
      t.test
      
      
4) Plots
    win/lose stuff


5) Introduce at least one function from CRAN that hasnâ€™t
been used in class
    caret, randomforest
    
6) Rmarkdown file (this is your final report)
    this file

```{r Data Manipulation}
# Reading in Catan data from data folder
CatanData <- read.csv(file = 'data/catanstats.csv', header = TRUE)

# Creating object that has all of the desired colors
colors <- c("red", "blue", "white", "orange")

# Creating new variable for color
# Split separates the observations by game Num, 50 groups for 50 games
# lapply does the random sample of colors for each group within each group
# This way, each color is found in each game without repeats within games
# Unlist separates data back into individual observations
CatanData$color <- unlist(
  lapply(
    split(CatanData, CatanData$gameNum),
    function(group)
    sample(colors))
  )

### Bootstrapping, simulating winners sample ###

# Summarizing the data#

print(summary)

###Key Takeaways: 
# Wood, Ore, and Sheep seem to be the most important resources for starting a winning settlement, as they have the highest mean counts.
# Resources like Clay, Desert, and combinations like 2 Sheep (2S) or 3 Gold (3G) seem to be less important.
# If your strategy is to pick starting resources that lead to the most wins, focusing on Wood (W) and Ore (O), followed by Sheep (S) and Wheat (L) might be a strong choice.

###Incorperating wieght of Token count (# associated with the resource)
library(ggplot2)

# Create the plot
ggplot(summary, aes(x = reorder(resource, -mean_count), y = mean_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Frequency of Resources in Winning First Settlements",
    x = "Resource",
    y = "Mean Count",
    caption = "Based on 10,000 bootstrap iterations"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

#Creating a weighting function

# Assuming each resource is tied to a specific number token in your dataset
resource_weights <- tibble(
  resource = c("W", "O", "S", "L", "C", "2S", "D", "3G", "2L", "2W"),
  token = c(6, 8, 5, 10, 3, 12, 2, 11, 4, 9)
)

# Frequency weights based on the number token roll probabilities
number_weights <- tibble(
  token = c(6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 10, 3, 11, 2, 12),
  weight = c(5/36, 5/36, 4/36, 4/36, 3/36, 3/36, 2/36, 2/36, 1/36, 1/36)
)

# Join the resource weights with the number weights
# First, ensure the summary table contains 'resource' and 'mean_count'
weighted_resources <- summary %>%
  left_join(resource_weights, by = "resource") %>%
  left_join(number_weights, by = "token") %>%
  mutate(weighted_count = mean_count * weight)

# Check the result
weighted_resources

#Visualizing weighted counts#
# Plot the weighted resources
ggplot(weighted_resources, aes(x = reorder(resource, -weighted_count), y = weighted_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Weighted Average Frequency of Resources in Winning First Settlements",
    x = "Resource",
    y = "Weighted Mean Count",
    caption = "Weights based on Catan number token roll probabilities"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

#interpreting#
# Higher weighted mean counts indicate that a resource is not only common in winning first settlements but also tied to highly valuable tiles that are rolled frequently in the game (like 6 or 8).
# Lower weighted mean counts indicate that a resource may appear in settlements but is associated with less frequent tiles (like 2 or 12), or it might just not be as influential in winning settlements.
